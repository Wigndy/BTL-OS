===== CFS vs MLQ SCHEDULER COMPARISON =====

| Metric               | CFS        | MLQ        | Difference    | Better    |
|----------------------|------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Average Wait Time    | 8.40      | 5.80      | 2.60 (31.0%) | MLQ     |
| Average Turnaround   | 13.20      | 19.00      | 5.80 (30.5%) | CFS     |
| Average Response     | 8.40      | 5.80      | 2.60 (31.0%) | MLQ     |
| Total Runtime        | 26        | 26        | 0 (0.0%) | Tie     |

===== ANALYSIS =====

- MLQ provides better average waiting time
- CFS provides better overall turnaround time

Conclusions:
- Results are mixed; scheduler choice depends on optimization goals:
  * Choose CFS for better turnaround time
  * Choose MLQ for better waiting time
